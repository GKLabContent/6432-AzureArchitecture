# Challenge 1 Demonstration

In this demonstration you will create the following:
1. A virtual network with two subnets
2. Two NICs - one on each subnet
3. A public IP address associated with one of the NICs
4. A virtual machine that uses both NICs

There are a powershell script and a deployment template that deploy the resources.  You can choose either one, the student instructions use the PowerShell script.  If using the PowerShell script, replace the variables at the top of the script.  If using the deployment template, set the parameters in the parameter file.

* The script is named complexVM.ps2.
* The deployment template is part of the module2.sln Visual Studio solution. The files are module2-Deploy.json and module2-Deploy.parameters.json under the module2\demo\module2 folder.
